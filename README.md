# Open Social Buttons

## About
This social buttons pack was created out of my frustration to find a social button pack that provided the following criteria.

- Up-to-date
	- Should contain up-to-date logos
	- Should reflect the brands current colour scene		
- Broad and extendable
	- This pack should contain all common social OAuth providers
	- The pack should remain open design to allow more providers to be added
	- The guidelines should be easy to follow to allow
- Be scaleable
	- All buttons should be made to be infinitely scaleable
	- All buttons should elegantly scale well
- Follow style guidelines
	- All buttons should follow guidelines closely so long as they do not interferer with the consistency of the collection itself
- Be maintainable
	- Brands change and new startups are born lets harness a community to ensure the page remains consistent with branding
- Be easily implemented
	- Provide ready to use OptiPNG optimised PNGs
	- Provide consistently named files
	- Provide consistently sized files
	- Provide @2x images for HiDPI screens
